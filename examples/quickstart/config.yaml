# vens - Vulnerability Risk Scoring Configuration
# Documentation: https://github.com/venslabs/vens#readme
#
# This config provides context for OWASP Risk Rating of vulnerabilities.
# The LLM scores EACH vulnerability based on its specific characteristics
# within YOUR system context.
# Reference: https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

context:
  # ============================================================================
  # MANDATORY FIELDS - Define your system's risk profile
  # ============================================================================

  # EXPOSURE: How is the system exposed to attackers?
  # Values: internal | private | internet
  #   - internal: Corporate network only, no external access
  #   - private: Requires VPN or authentication to access
  #   - internet: Publicly accessible from the internet
  # Impact: Affects Threat Agent score for remote vulnerabilities
  exposure: "internet"

  # DATA SENSITIVITY: What type of data does the system handle?
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  #   - low: Public data, no confidentiality requirements
  #   - medium: Internal data, limited confidentiality
  #   - high: PII, financial data, customer information
  #   - critical: Secrets, credentials, PHI, payment card data
  # Impact: Affects Technical Impact score for confidentiality/integrity vulnerabilities
  data_sensitivity: "high"

  # BUSINESS CRITICALITY: How critical is this system for business?
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  #   - low: Development/test environments
  #   - medium: Internal tools, non-essential services
  #   - high: Customer-facing services, important operations
  #   - critical: Revenue-critical, compliance-required, core business
  # Impact: Affects Business Impact score (all vulnerabilities)
  business_criticality: "high"

  # ============================================================================
  # OPTIONAL FIELDS - Provide additional context for precise scoring
  # ============================================================================

  # AVAILABILITY REQUIREMENT: How critical is uptime? (optional)
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  # Default: Inherits from business_criticality if not specified
  # When to use: Set explicitly if availability needs differ from business criticality
  # Impact: Affects Technical Impact score for DoS/availability vulnerabilities
  availability_requirement: "high"

  # COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS: What regulations apply? (optional)
  # Supported: PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001, FISMA, FedRAMP, SOX, NIST, CCPA, CMMC, ITAR
  # Default: Empty (no compliance)
  # When to use: If non-compliance has legal/financial consequences
  # Impact: Increases Business Impact score for compliance-relevant vulnerabilities (+2)
  compliance_requirements:
    - "GDPR"
    - "SOC2"

  # AUDIT REQUIREMENT: How critical is audit logging? (optional)
  # Values: low | medium | high
  # Default: Not specified (accountability vulnerabilities scored lower)
  # When to use: Financial systems, compliance-critical systems requiring forensic logs
  # Impact: Affects Technical Impact score for accountability vulnerabilities
  audit_requirement: "high"

  # SECURITY CONTROLS: What defenses are in place? (optional)
  # Default: All false (no controls assumed)
  # When to use: You have active security controls that reduce exploitability
  # Impact: Reduces Vulnerability score when controls block specific attack types
  controls:
    # Perimeter controls
    waf: true                    # Web Application Firewall (reduces web exploit scores)
    ddos_protection: true        # DDoS mitigation (reduces DoS scores)

    # Detection controls
    ids: true                    # Intrusion Detection System (reduces network exploit scores)
    siem: true                   # Security Information & Event Management

    # Endpoint controls
    edr: false                   # Endpoint Detection & Response (reduces malware scores)
    antivirus: false             # Antivirus/Anti-malware

    # Network controls
    segmentation: true           # Network micro-segmentation (reduces lateral movement)
    zero_trust: false            # Zero-trust architecture

  # ADDITIONAL NOTES: Free-form context (optional)
  # Default: Empty
  # When to use: Provide extra details that help understand risk (architecture, threat model, etc.)
  # Impact: Helps LLM make better decisions on edge cases
  notes: "Customer-facing REST API built with FastAPI/Flask running on Python 3.11-slim (Debian). Handles authentication, user data, and payment processing. Uses PostgreSQL database. Deployed in Kubernetes behind load balancer. Container runs as non-root user. SSL/TLS terminated at load balancer. Rate limiting and input validation implemented. Regular security patches applied monthly."
