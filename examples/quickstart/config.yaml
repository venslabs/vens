# OWASP Risk Rating (0-9 scale for each factor)
# Final Risk = Likelihood × Impact
# Reference: https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

owasp:
  # === LIKELIHOOD (How probable is the attack?) ===
  
  threat_agent: 7
  # Who might attack? Their skill, motivation, and opportunity
  # 0-3: Script kiddies, opportunistic attacks
  # 4-6: Skilled attackers, moderate resources
  # 7-9: Organized crime, nation-states, APT groups
  
  vulnerability: 6
  # How easy is it to find and exploit vulnerabilities?
  # 0-3: Very difficult, requires insider knowledge
  # 4-6: Public CVEs, some tools available
  # 7-9: Trivial, automated scanners, known exploits

  # === IMPACT (What damage if successful?) ===
  
  technical_impact: 7
  # Damage to systems, data, and infrastructure
  # 0-3: Minor data disclosure, limited access
  # 4-6: Significant data loss, service disruption
  # 7-9: Complete system compromise, data destruction
  
  business_impact: 8
  # Consequences for the business
  # 0-3: Minimal financial/reputation loss
  # 4-6: Moderate losses, customer complaints
  # 7-9: Bankruptcy risk, regulatory fines, brand destruction

# Calculated Risk Score Example:
# Likelihood = (threat_agent + vulnerability) / 2 = (7 + 6) / 2 = 6.5
# Impact = (technical_impact + business_impact) / 2 = (7 + 8) / 2 = 7.5
# Risk = Likelihood × Impact = 6.5 × 7.5 = 48.75 / 81
# Severity: CRITICAL (score > 40)
