  description: "Production NGINX web server exposed to internet"

# Context hints for OWASP Risk Rating
# These hints help the LLM calculate accurate risk scores for each vulnerability
# Reference: https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

context:
  # === EXPOSURE ===
  # How is the system exposed to potential attackers?
  # Values: internal | private | internet
  #   - internal: Corporate network only, no external access
  #   - private: Requires VPN or authentication to access
  #   - internet: Publicly accessible from the internet
  exposure: "internet"

  # === DATA SENSITIVITY ===
  # What type of data does the system handle?
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  #   - low: Public data, no confidentiality requirements
  #   - medium: Internal data, limited confidentiality
  #   - high: PII, financial data, customer information
  #   - critical: Secrets, credentials, PHI, payment card data
  data_sensitivity: "high"

  # === BUSINESS CRITICALITY ===
  # How critical is this system for business operations?
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  #   - low: Development/test environments
  #   - medium: Internal tools, non-essential services
  #   - high: Customer-facing services, important operations
  #   - critical: Revenue-critical, compliance-required, core business
  business_criticality: "critical"

  # === ADDITIONAL NOTES (optional) ===
  # Free-form text to provide extra context for the LLM
  # Examples: compliance requirements, specific threats, architecture details
  notes: "Handles customer PII, PCI-DSS compliance required, serves as reverse proxy for backend APIs"
